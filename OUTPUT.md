## Expected Scraper Output
Below, you'll find a JSON Schema that we'll expect your scrapers to output. Take note: this schema is designed to be as flexible as possible, for example, *both "2005-06-15T12:00:00Z" and "April 13th at 4pm" are valid entries in the `created_at` field*. Why is this? We want to make writing scrapers as easy and pain-free as possible. Scrapers should simply target HTML elements and extract their contents -- if those contents need to be transformed, we'll do that when we load the data into a database.

> This is a living document -- we expect it to become more complete as we write more scrapers. (Feel free to include a change to this document as you write scrapers.)
